# Fresh Hearts

Fresh Hearts is a machine learning AI application developed using Streamlit. This project focuses on testing and predicting heart disease risks by analyzing clinical markers. It aims to assist medical practitioners and researchers in assessing heart disease likelihood efficiently through modern computational techniques.

## Features

This application evaluates the following clinical markers to predict heart disease risks:

- **Age**: Age of the patient [Numeric, in years].
- **Sex**: Gender of the patient [1: Male, 0: Female].
- **CP (Chest Pain Type)**:
  - 0: Typical Angina.
  - 1: Atypical Angina.
  - 2: Non-Anginal Pain.
  - 3: Asymptomatic.
- **Trestbps**: Resting blood pressure [Numeric, in mm Hg].
- **Chol**: Serum cholesterol level [Numeric, in mg/dl].
- **Fbs**: Fasting blood sugar [1: if fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl, 0: otherwise].
- **Restecg**: Resting electrocardiographic results:
  - 0: Normal.
  - 1: Having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV).
  - 2: Showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria.
